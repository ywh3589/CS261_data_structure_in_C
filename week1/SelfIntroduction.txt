It seemed more helpful and student-centered than other institutes. 
-Even if it was an education done Online, it seemed well organized and I can get lots of helps from the instructors and other teaching assistants.
-Oregn State University itself seemed like a school which cares students and nature more than the other schools.


What are your interests(beyond data structures of course!)?
-my interest is complex theory. story about barabashi
-studying on algorithms.


What hobbies do you enjoy? 
-I love reading books shopping books and watching documentary

What is your major?
- international realations


What do you intend to do after graduation?
-I want to apply for graduate school. I want to do research on algorithm and complexity theory.

What would you like to be doing in five or ten years?
-In five years, I would like to do my research on computer science at graduate school, 
in 10 years I would like to get a job as a researcher from a company or school.


Do you have an interest in research?
-As I enrolled in this program to make myself more qualified for graduate school in computer science field.
I have an interst in research definitely. 


If you need more topics you might want to address some computer science issues of the day,

such as why computer science in general had a significant reduction in enrollment from about 2004-2010



In a sepearate section, previous programming experience has been. what language do you know? how many years of 
experience you have with each, whiat programming related classes you have taken, and for each language you list
the platforms you have developed on and the build environment you have used(command lines, MS visual studio?)
